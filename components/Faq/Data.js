        "The primary role of the Police is not to arrest and constraint. Despite being a prevention authority, the police force is also used as a tool to sensitize and send a loud message to the public “the rule of law is in force on the ground”. Reporting police sightings or speed traps on Comute can help other drivers regulate their speed, avoiding both accidents and other potential traffic offenses and collateral damages. It's legal to report police sightings on Comute in the various countrie, but the same may not be true everywhere — be sure to check local laws if you plan to use the app in a specific country. Turns out that some police agencies have said that Comute could be used as a “police stalker” application, making it easier for would-be cop scavengers to track down and harm police personnel; this can fight  both crime and as well as harassment on road and in the community. Seriously, that's what they think."
